# EmailTrack
## This simple PHP class outputs a ghost image and uses PDO & SQLite to track whether or not an email has been seen.


## REQUIREMENTS
- PHP 5.3+
- PDO_SQLITE driver


## CONCEPT
Wherever you send an email that needs to be tracked, weâ€™ll just inject an image that ACTUALLY loads a PHP file on our server. The PHP class that is requested in the `<img...` tag, takes `$_GET` parameters, logs them in the SQLite database, then serves up an actual image.


## PARAMETERS
```php
$message .= '<img src="/src/blank.php?log=true&subject='.urlencode($subject).'&email='.urlencode($to).'" alt="EmailTrack"/>';
```
-------------------------------------
|   **Key**   |     **Value**       |
|-------------|---------------------|
| ?log        | true                |
| &subject    | urlencode($subject) |
| &email      | urlencode($to)      |
-------------------------------------


## INSTALLATION
- Full instructions and examples are located in the `examples` folder.
- The class file resides in `src/blank.php`
- **You may need to edit paths to the SQLite database/gif in the class settings.**
- *SQLite databases can pose a security risk, and may be downloaded with a direct link! Please take precautions to secure the file. You can so this with Apache `.htaccess` or by making the file hidden.*
